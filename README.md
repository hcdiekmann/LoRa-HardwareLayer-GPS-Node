# Peer-to-peer LoRa GPS node

 ### Function:
  - HTCC-AB01 board, as a battery powered GPS node can read its battery voltage and transmits the reading via LoRa peer-to-peer.
  - Acquire the current GPS coordinates, altitude and velocity and tansmitt the values via LoRa (chirp spread spectrum).

 ### Description:
  - Only hardware layer communication, no LoRaWAN protocol.
  - Communication with any other LoRa device possible, eg. ESP32 LoRa, STM32 LoRa, etc.
